Currently using gnome-terminal on Ubuntu 14.04  
an equivalent to PowerShells `ii` is `gnome-open <dir>`  
e.g. `gnome-open ~` opens the home directory.
Is there an equivalent to `ii .` to open the current working directory?

How to make a command? Or an alias which invokes a shell script, like the nap.sh script?
