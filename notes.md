Currently using _gnome-terminal_ on *Ubuntu* 14.04  

http://askubuntu.com/questions/38661/how-do-i-run-sh-files  
`chmod +x /path/to/yourscript.sh`  

There is an alternative to the octothorpe for comments:

An equivalent to PowerShells `ii` (invoke-item) is `gnome-open <dir>`  
e.g. `gnome-open ~` opens the home directory.  
Also, an equivalent to `ii .` to open the current working directory is `gnome-open .`  

How to make a command? Or an alias which invokes a shell script, like the nap.sh script?
